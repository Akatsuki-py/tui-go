A UI library for terminal applications.

tui-go provides a higher-level programming model for building rich terminal
applications. It lets you build layout-based user interfaces that (should)
gracefully handle resizing for you.

## Status

This project is highly experimental and will change a lot. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go
```

## Documentation

The documentation is rather bare at the moment due to me changing the API
pretty frequently. You can however explore the API in its current form at
[godoc.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go).

## Contributing

I'm currently not accepting contributions or bug reports due to the project
being pretty volatile at the moment. That being said, feel free to create an
GitHub issue to suggest features you'd like to see.
